Create a python code that is exposed via ngrok.now this nrrok url will be accseed
vaia na post medthos via an app.the post method will contain image data as an base64 format and 
a gps location and time and date and and the user credentil of the user calling the api enpoint of this code.
now retrive the gps location sent  and using that location call  google earth engine api and retrive 5 previous images of that 
location.after retrieving that image convert that image to gray sclae and do a check if there is any change in the images 
then loctaion sent will be of mangrove forest and that previous 5 images will be used to check if there is any decrease in the area in which
teh magroves were thaeere i.e if they are cut or not or there any deforedtation thus use the current date and time image thatis sent via the app
as a standard and compare it with the previous 5 images and using ai detect if there is significant decrresase in magroves in that area
and create a certain threshold limit that will deteremine if there is actual decrese in the number of trees or not and then sem the 
percentage difference in that image and the previous images.

points which are to be kept in mind.
1] there should be detection of decrease in the area of mangroves i.e deforestation.
2] if there is any mangrove poisoning in that area i.e detect it via the change in color of the tress in that area i.e if they are lush
green the they are not poisoned and if they are turning pale that means there is poisoning in that mangrove area.
use an appropriate image detection algo for the above criteria and keep in mind there are no errors in it.



Create a python code that have api endpoints that will be called by an app. the app acll the endpoint and will haev some
data attached to it which is 
1] an image in the form of base64
2] latitude
3] longitude 
4] date and time info
now we have to fetch teh longitude and latitude from the call and use it to find the images of that location on the 
Google earth engine. there should be 5 images that will be used taht are already present on GEE before the date and time
that is sent in the api call.now use the previous 5 images of that location and the most recent image of that location for the 
called date and time and check for 2things 
1] is there any deforestation of mangroves after to the historiacl and cuurent images processing
2] is there any poisoning in the region of the mangroves
for the above detection you can use gray sacling and matrix cal for change in grayscale and paleness detection for poisoning 
the api should return an analysis fi there is any deforestation or poisoning of the mangroves.
the image data sent with the call willl be dealth with later development stage just implement thsi much now keep in mind
taht thsi api willnbe called from an app thus this code should run not locally but publically so that it oculd be called 
use mgrok for that
